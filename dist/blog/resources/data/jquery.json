Undoubtedly, though, many will be reviewing their investment plans.GM is describing its decision as a change in business model. Its plant in St Petersburg will close in mid-2015, while contract manufacturing of Chevrolet vehicles, performed through local manufacturer GAZ, will finish by the year-end.GM's joint venture with AvtoVAZ, the dominant Russian manufacturer (famous for its Lada cars), will continue, but most of GM's business in Russia will now be done through imports. The focus will turn to the group's premium cars, such as Cadillacs, and Opel, GM's mass-market European badge, will leave Russia altogether.The company's president, Dan Ammann, says GM's aim is to avoid investing more in a country that has very challenging long-term prospects. Still, although GM has been sustained by its strength in the US and China over the past few years, its other international operations have also been struggling.The company is not only retrenching in Russia; it also ended production in Indonesia earlier this year. Opel, in particular, has been loss-making for six years now and, if it is ever to turn itself around, needs to focus investment on the most promising European markets."]

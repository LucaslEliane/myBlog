General Motors (GM) has announced plans to end nearly all its production in Russia by the end of this year.Other car firms appear to be staying put in the hope of tapping into long-term growth. Undoubtedly, though, many will be reviewing their investment plans.GM is describing its decision as a change in business model. Its plant in St Petersburg will close in mid-2015, while contract manufacturing of Chevrolet vehicles, performed through local manufacturer GAZ, will finish by the year-end.GM's joint venture with AvtoVAZ, the dominant Russian manufacturer (famous for its Lada cars), will continue, but most of GM's business in Russia will now be done through imports. The focus will turn to the group's premium cars, such as Cadillacs, and Opel, GM's mass-market European badge, will leave Russia altogether."]

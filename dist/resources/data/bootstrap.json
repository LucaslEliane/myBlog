    "passageContent": "There is no escaping, though, that Russia does not count among those. Despite the dominance of cars made by foreigners (often in joint ventures), the Russian market has steadfastly refused to meet their expectations.In 2010, for example, Carlos Ghosn, head of Renault-Nissan, was predicting that by 2014 Russian car sales would be around 4m. His company was in the process of buying control of AvtoVAZ, a deal finally completed in 2014. By that point, however, Russian car sales were just under 2.5m - well short of Mr Ghosn's projections.Russia's decision to annexe Crimea and its continued meddling in Ukraine are the most immediate causes. The resulting international sanctions have seen economic growth stall and the rouble plummet, raising the price of imported cars and car-parts (GM imports most components, intensifying its pain).The drop in global oil prices has added to Russia's woes. A car scrappage scheme, giving buyers an incentive to trade in older vehicles, managed to halt the sales slump in the last few months of 2014, but has now expired. With the government struggling to repair its budget as tax revenues fall, the programme is unlikely to resume.As a result, sales in the first two months of 2015 were down 32% year on year, according to Russia's Association of European Businesses, with most vehicles in Russia being sold at a loss. Among the worst performers, Chevrolet sales plummeted by 71% and Opel's by 82%.Few escaped unscathed, however. The only carmakers to see growth were luxury players such as BMW, Mercedes and Porsche, and mass-market Hyundai, which has become the largest non-Russian producer in the market."

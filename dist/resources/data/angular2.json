Interest rates remain high, having been hiked in response to the economic crisis. This, together with galloping inflation and tumbling incomes, will continue to depress consumer sentiment.At the same time, lasting weakness in the rouble will make imported cars and inputs for domestic producers much more expensive. As the Russian economy shrinks by a forecast 3.5% in 2015, we expect car sales to drop even more steeply, contracting by over one-fifth to just below 2m.Beyond this, there is more room for optimism. We expect a recovery in autos demand from 2016. Travel bans and asset freezes for individuals affected by EU sanctions have been extended by six months until September, but we believe the main European sectoral sanctions will be eased in July 2015.This should eventually feed through into lower financing costs for automakers and some upturn in sentiment among businesses and consumers. Moreover, Russia's well-developed dealer and logistics infrastructure should mean economic growth boost car sales relatively quickly. New registrations will accelerate into 2017, averaging around 8% in 2016-19.Yet this is a much slower rebound than was seen after the previous recession. Within our forecast period to 2019, sales will not return to their 2008 high of 3.3m, and will struggle to regain even 2012 levels. It is hard to foresee a time when Russia offers carmakers an easy ride.Click here to subscribe to The Economist"

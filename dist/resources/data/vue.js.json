The 10% drop in car sales last year paled in comparison that of 2009, when new registrations halved following the financial crisis.Even so, the optimism that sustained international makers through those earlier troughs appears to be running out. General Motors (GM) has announced plans to end nearly all its production in Russia by the end of this year.Other car firms appear to be staying put in the hope of tapping into long-term growth. Undoubtedly, though, many will be reviewing their investment plans.GM is describing its decision as a change in business model. Its plant in St Petersburg will close in mid-2015, while contract manufacturing of Chevrolet vehicles, performed through local manufacturer GAZ, will finish by the year-end."
